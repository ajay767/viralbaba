        <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet. Where HTML is what defines the structure and content of a web page, a
            Cascading Style Sheet is a web document that allows you to change the appearance of the HTML.CSS allows you
            to change the size, style, font, and color of text; margins and padding; background colors and border
            styles. It can also be used to position elements on a page (but we’ll leave that for another day).</p>

        <p>Here’s an example of what I mean: as we learned last week, the page title on a blog page is defined by an
            HTML element called an H1 (heading 1). By default, the browser displays an H1 as extra large, bold, black
            text, much like we saw in the PAWS example.If we want to change the color, font and size of all the H1’s on
            our blog to keep consistency throughout, all you need to do is define what all H1’s will look like in your
            CSS.</p>

        <p>from top to bottom in a style sheet. This means that a style you define lower in the style sheet will
            override any previous styles defined earlier in the style sheet.We’ll get into that in a moment.You can also
            have a style sheet override another style sheet. This is how we are able to override predefined styles from
            our blog themes or plugin widgets, as our custom style sheet is usually the last one read by the browser.
